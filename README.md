# LLM-md

> A Markdown-based protocol for building a clean, machine-native web — optimized for Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT.

---

## 🧠 What is `llm-md`?

`llm-md` is a proposed convention and toolset that allows any website to serve a **clean, structured, Markdown version** of its content — specifically tailored for machine consumption by LLMs, AI agents, and crawling bots.

The goal is to reduce the noise, latency, and guesswork LLMs face when parsing HTML, JavaScript-heavy, or unstructured pages.

---

## 🚧 Why This Matters

LLMs often have to:
- Crawl noisy HTML
- Render JavaScript to access dynamic content
- Use fragile extraction rules
- Tokenize bloated, unstructured text

With `llm-md`, content is:
- Pre-cleaned and semantically marked
- Lightweight and consistent
- Easier to crawl, process, and understand
- Versioned, human-readable, and AI-readable

---

## 🔁 How It Works

For any content URL, provide a `.md` version at a predictable alias:

**Human URL:**

https://example.com/articles/quantum-computing

**LLM-readable Markdown:**

https://example.com/articles/quantum-computing.llm.md

OR:

https://example.com/.llm/quantum-computing.md

---

## 🧱 Example Markdown Format

```markdown
---
title: "Quantum Computing Basics"
source_url: "https://example.com/articles/quantum-computing"
last_updated: "2025-07-06"
tags: ["quantum", "computing", "beginner"]

# Quantum Computing Basics

Quantum computing uses quantum bits (qubits)...

## Key Concepts

- Superposition
- Entanglement
- Quantum Gates


⸻

🔍 Use Cases
• Faster, cheaper web crawling for AI
• Search engines optimized for structured content
• AI agents browsing the “machine-readable” web
• Documentation or blogs offering .llm.md as an alias
• Browser extensions or GPT plugins using cleaner views

⸻

📦 Project Components (Coming Soon)
• llm-md-crawler: Simple CLI to fetch .llm.md version of any page
• llm-md-validator: Checks structure, metadata, and format
• llm-md-template: Starter template for static sites
• llm-md-protocol: Living spec for aliasing + content rules

⸻

💡 Get Involved

This project is in its early ideation phase, and we’re looking for:
• Feedback on the protocol idea
• Use cases or integrations
• Tool builders, web authors, AI engineers
• Early experiments and adopters

### ✅ Your Next Steps:

1. Create your repo: `llm-md`
2. Paste this into your `README.md`
3. (Optional) Create a basic `/examples/` folder with a few `.llm.md` test docs
4. Add a GitHub topic: `llm`, `markdown`, `ai-web`, `crawler`, `spec`

---

Let me know when you're ready for:
- 🧪 First crawler tool
- 📜 Protocol spec draft (`spec.md`)
- 🖼️ Architecture diagram (before/after LLM pipeline)

You're officially building the **machine-readable layer of the web**. Let's go.
